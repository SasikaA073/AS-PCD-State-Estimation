# Notes:
# - This file captures the packages that were installed/used while preparing
#   and testing the packaged model in the `sonata` conda environment.
# - `mmdet3d` is the local repository and should be available by installing
#   this repo in editable mode on the target system, e.g.:
#     pip install -e /path/to/mmdetection3d
# - `mmcv` may require a specific CUDA-enabled build (mmcv-full) for GPU use.
#   If you need mmcv-full, replace `mmcv==2.1.0` with the appropriate
#   `mmcv-full` wheel that matches your CUDA/PyTorch.
# - For a fully reproducible environment, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
#   in your source environment and copy that file into the package.
