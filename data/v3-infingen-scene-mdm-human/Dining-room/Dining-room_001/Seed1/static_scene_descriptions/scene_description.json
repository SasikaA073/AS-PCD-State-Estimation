    "scene_description": "The dining room is a rectangular space with silver walls and ceiling over a dark brown, tile-like floor, centered around a black rectangular table placed slightly left of center and oriented lengthwise toward the back wall; four mixed-finish chairs (two gray, two brown) surround it, with one at each end and two along the sides. Along the left wall behind the table runs a long, low black cabinet that stretches toward the back-left corner, where a black planter with greenery sits; above this wall a narrow black-framed window is set high. The back wall is lined with pale storage: an ivory cabinet stands to the left of a gray door, while to the right a wide ivory shelving unit with alternating open and closed cubbies is flanked by a tall, narrow ivory cabinet at the far-right corner; a small black shelf and a larger ivory shelf also occupy the left half of the room near the window, and a low black shelf sits toward the rear-right side. Overhead, compact ceiling lights in silver and black are spaced across the room, with one roughly above the dining set and others distributed toward the left and right, leaving clear circulation from the table toward the door."
